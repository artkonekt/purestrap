Purestrap is a loosely coupled set of ported [bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) css components mixed with [Pure.css's](http://purecss.io) great grid system.

The result is a set of sass files which can be used and customized freely based on your needs. They are glued together and construct a standalone framework.

The toolset was built with [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) principles in mind.
