# PureStrap

Purestrap is a loosely coupled set of [bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) compatible css components mixed with [Pure.css's](http://purecss.io) great grid system.

The result is a set of sass files which can be used and customized freely based on your needs. They are glued together and constructs a standalone framework.
