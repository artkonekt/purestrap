<h1>Purestrap Documentation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The component set is basically a mixture of purecss's grid system and several basic bootstrap components.</p>
<p>It also provides with a nice dead simple responsive layout that fits most of the devices used as of 2016.</p>
<h3>Why Another Toolset?</h3>
<p>First, this toolkit has been created primarily for our own internal use, so don't use it if you don't like it.</p>
<p>Second, it's not aimed to completely replace bootstrap or foundation.</p>
<p>OK I described what not. This thing aims to overcome the following issues met during the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap by default forces me to use gutters between grid columns, while purecss doesn't</li>
<li>Bootstrap3's grid system has had multiple issues/limitations (which problems are just about to be eliminated in BS4 btw)</li>
<li>Most bootstrap themes seem to be &quot;one of a kind&quot;</li>
<li>Customizing bootstrap oftean means taking a vanilla bootstrap CSS and overwriting it, resulting in a messy and ineffective CSS</li>
<li>There are many nice <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/">tools</a> for <a href="http://bootstrap-live-customizer.com/">customizing</a> bootstrap but none of them actually fits my workflow</li>
<li>Wanted to have edit directly the sass source files during development</li>
<li>Wanted to have a clean css at the end of the day (no)</li>
<li>Bootstrap's configuration/theming option set is overcomplicated which I never was able to grasp completely</li>
<li>With all that, bootstrap is still a very nice animal and all my workmates know it, so no need to reinvent the wheel and replace <code>&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot;&gt;meh&lt;/div&gt;</code> and all the stuff like that.</li>
</ul>
